This is why they are at the centre of the European Union strategy and its Cohesion policy. Indeed, countries and regions have designed a Research and Innovation strategy for Smart Specialisation (RIS3) to guide public investment in the coming years.\nTo check whether their policies, investment decisions and projects are delivering, regions and countries need an effective monitoring system, and this course aims at supporting this process. \nThis MOOC, organised by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC), answers some of the key questions related to monitoring RIS3, addressing conceptual, policy and empirical aspects.     \n\nWho is this course for?\n\nThis course is open to anyone interested in monitoring knowledge-based regional development, and in particular monitoring Smart Specialisation Strategies. Whilst it is designed with EU regions and member states specifically in mind, the principles and ideas discussed should be of relevance to a broader audience.    \n\nParticular groups include:  \n\n\nCivil servants working on regional development at the regional, national and European level\nStudents or researchers interested in regional development, or research and innovation policies\nConsultants in regional development or research and innovation policy\n\n\nWhat do I need to know?\n\nPrevious knowledge and experience in Cohesion Policy and monitoring is an advantage but it is not a compulsory prerequisite. A good command of English is essential.   \n\nWhat will I learn?\n\n\nThe principles underpinning RIS3 and RIS3 monitoring\nThe nature of the core-indicators relevant to monitoring RIS3\nThe potential data-sources needed to monitor RIS3\nThe role of stakeholders in monitoring\nThe tactics for a successful use of monitoring\n\n\nMainly, by the end of the course you will understand why there is no shortcut to monitoring, and why it is crucial to develop a good monitoring system.   \n\nCourse Structure\n\nChapter 1 - Introduction\n\nIn the first chapter we will introduce RIS3, present the S3 platform and our activities of targeted support, as well as provide an overview of the course.  \n\nChapter 2 – Output and Result Indicators\n\nChapter 2 is technical in nature and describes output and result indicators, the core elements of monitoring RIS3.  \n\nChapter 3 – Data Sources\n\nChapter 3 discusses the different data-sources to build Output and Result indicators, highlighting their pros and cons and pointing out the role of qualitative data in monitoring, the relevance and limits of international benchmarking. Chapter 3 also discusses how indicators should be built and data should be collected in different administrative settings.   \n\nChapter 4 – Stakeholder Engagement\n\nRIS3 is a participatory process and stakeholders are critical not only in the design of the strategy, but also in its monitoring process. Chapter 4 explains why and provides some real examples.  \n\nChapter 5 – Effectiveness of monitoring\n\nThe last chapter will focus on the key ingredients for success when developing a monitoring system, highlighting the importance of communication to decision makers.   \n","currency_unit":"€","amount":"300/month","instructors":[{"name":"Dr Elisabetta Marinelli","bio":"Elisabetta Marinelli is a Scientific Officer at the European Commission Joint Research Centre (Seville, Spain).  An economist by training, she holds a PhD from the London School of Economics.  She has published articles in journals such as Regional Studies, Technovation, Environment and Planning and The Journal of Business Research.

It&#39;s no surprise. In today&#39;s rapidly changing business landscape, knowing how to quickly navigate complex problems, break down constant incoming information and respond to new situations puts professionals at an incredible advantage.  \n\nDo you need to convince a client? If you structure your proposal like a mathematician and write it like a columnist, you will. This course will provide you with better tools for understanding and approaching challenges in today&#39;s business environment. We will analyse the logical structure behind business proposals, business strategies and everyday plain communication, in order to make more informed and better decisions. We will test the assumptions and hypotheses in our business models, understand the mechanisms of bad reasoning (fallacies) and learn how to respond to and avoid being misled in communication. Cognitive biases affect our behaviour as consumers, managers or entrepreneurs - in this course, we will understand how that happens and how we can combat as well as work with these biases. Finally, you will better discover your own ways of thinking, both conscious and unconscious, testing and challenging your own cognitive strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWhat will I learn?\n\nParticipants will be able to see and evaluate the logic behind business communication, structure better arguments in order to become more convincing, avoid rational and irrational pitfalls, know how to test strategies before deploying and challenge their own habitual thinking patterns.\n\n\nWho should take this course\n\nNo prior knowledge is needed for this course, participants should only come open- and fair-minded.  \n\nIf you are an economic actor or working in a business environment, this PRO course is for you. The course provides useful insights for employees, managers, entrepreneurs, young professionals entering the job market, as well as all of us day-to-day consumers.\n\n\nCourse Structure\n\n![enter image description here]\n\nChapter 1: Introduction\nWhat is Critical Thinking and why is it important in the business environment?\n\n\nChapter 2: We think in arguments\nWe get to see the logic structure behind any text or speech in business communication. We learn when to trust statements, hidden assumptions, opinions and beliefs (including our own). We evaluate business proposals, business strategy, in order to be able to make better decisions. All this will be organised with a step-by-step approach alongside relevant examples.\n\n\nChapter 3: Don&#39;t be fooled! Fallacies and Cognitive Biases \n We are often misled by bad reasoning (fallacies), regardless if the bad reasoning comes from the others (with or without intent) or from ourselves. Sometimes we make mistakes without thinking at all (cognitive biases). But when such concepts can be named, studied and exemplified, we are less likely to err again. In this chapter there is also a unit on the smart use of heuristics in business. \n\n\nChapter 4: Test your assumptions \nAll the things that we know about the way our world functions (all sciences) are based on the scientific method. The corner stone of validating a scientific theory is designing and conducting well thought out experiments. Why shouldn’t we do the same in business? Every strategy is based on some assumptions and hypotheses. Instead of basing our business conduct on a hunch, let’s recognise our assumptions and then design and conduct clever tests for them.\n\n\nChapter 5: Persuasion \nWe will put our skills to work and construct good arguments in order to be persuasive in writing, debates and pitches.\n\n\nChapter 6: How to be a critical thinker in a post-truth world?\n Today's media is dominated by post-truth in ways that were unthinkable two decades ago. We get most of our news from Facebook, we live in bubbles and echo-chambers. And this influences greatly our lives and our businesses. We dissect the phenomenon and provide some tools to tackle it. \n\n\nChapter 7: The courage to change your mind\nOnce we master critical thinking skills, we need to use them charitably and responsibly. Most importantly, we need to start by using them on our own businesses and on ourselves. It is easier to use critical thinking on the others, and not on ourselves, on our own strong beliefs and old misconceptions. We describe 9 mechanisms through which our minds cling to old beliefs (among these - groupthink, cognitive dissonance, backfire effect) and ways to counteract these mechanisms..\n\n\n\nWhat is included in this course\n\nBy enrolling in this course, you will gain access to:\n• All Course Material\n• Challenging &amp; Fun Assignments\n• Interactive Global Community\n• Flexible Time Management\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will receive:\n• A Statement of Participation   \n\nIn addition, this course offers flexible time management.

Over the last decade, wages for many workers have been stagnant and the largest part of the economic gains achieved has gone to the top of the income pyramid. Wage discrimination based on gender, ethnicity or employment status contributes towards greater inequality and violates the basic principle of equal pay for work of equal value. The market has been unable to ensure a fair distribution of wages and guarantee the well-being of ordinary people and social peace in our societies.\n\nWhere poverty and inequality have been reduced, this has mainly been thanks to the creation of regular waged jobs and a more equitable wage structure. Sustainable wage policies and fair wage setting mechanisms can contribute to a more equal and prosperous society for all. This course offers a mix of video lectures and interviews, readings, online resources and exercises to gain both knowledge and practical skills to understand the actual landscape of wage setting.\n\nThis is a free self-paced course in which you can study at your own pace and free of cost. You can enrol for free in the audit track and - if you wish - get a Statement of Participation for 29 € once you&#39;ve finished the course. When an exam phase is organized(, you will have the chance to get a University Certificate of Achievement for 49 € after passing an online exam. The Global Labour University may offer scholarships to participants from non-OECD countries and to trade unionists from OECD countries to do a Certificate for free. If you wish to get a Certificate for this course, please start studying in the audit track and send an email to online@global-labour-university.org to express your interest in an exam phase.\nYou can also visit the Global Labour University Online Academy to find other free online courses on International Labour Standards and Decent Work in Global Supply Chains and join the GLU Online Education Facebook Group.\nThe course includes the recording of two Facebook live discussions with experts from the Global Union Federation IndustriALL and the ILO. You can find the recording here.\n\nWhat do I need to know?\n\nThe course requires a working level of English. Some prior knowledge of wage policies and economics will make it easier to follow. However, theoretical concepts are explained in an accessible and user-friendly manner, so it is also possible to participate in the course using skills and knowledge acquired outside formal education.    \n\nWhat will I learn?\n\nThis course explains global wage trends and discusses the particularities and strategies of collective bargaining and minimum wages as wage setting mechanisms. The course presents global trends and analyses the relationship between wages and economic development, as well as the impact of migration, gender and racial discrimination on wages policies. After presenting the major challenges for setting fair wages today, the course will look at successful experiences and labour campaigns that resulted in better working and living conditions, and ongoing initiatives for living wages.   \n\nCourse Structure\n\nEach week, we will open a new chapter and the chapters will remain accessible once they are opened. So you can go back to prior chapters at any time. The estimated workload is 3-4 hours per week.  \n\nChapter 1: Political economy of wages\n\nThis chapter provides a general overview of the current global picture on wages. Senior experts from the International Labour Organisation (ILO), introduce the main global trends on wages and explain how non-standard forms of employment have impacted the world of work. The chief trade union negotiator for the new minimum wage in South Africa, discusses the political and economic challenges of wage setting, while a member of the Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC) to the OECD, explains the multiple purposes of collective bargaining. Participants will be invited to introduce themselves and share relevant material in an interactive world map.  \n\nChapter 2: The role of collective bargaining\n\nThis chapter focuses on the key role that collective bargaining plays for wage setting. ILO expert Susan Hayter describes the various actors in the bargaining process and how the different negotiation formats have a direct impact on current wage trends and wage-income distribution. Trade unionists from Argentina and Germany introduce different bargaining models and explain practical implications, including the right to strike as the underlying indispensable condition of any genuine bargaining process.     \n\nChapter 3: Minimum and living wages\n\nThis chapter introduces the concept and history of minimum wages, as well as the existing international labour standards that provide a regulatory framework for minimum wage setting. It also looks at the actual levels of country-level compliance. Experts from South Africa discuss what the policy considerations are when designing minimum wages and the benefits of setting minimum wages in a country with a very unequal wage distribution. Finally, the challenge of compliance with minimum wage regulations will be explored.       \n\nChapter 4: Macroeconomics of wages\n\nThis chapter untangles the relationship between wages and economic development. It discusses how wages are shaped by, and impact, different economic regimes, and then goes on to discuss the relationship between wages, inequality and economic policy. These topics are presented by economic experts from Europe and India. The chapter explains these fundamental and important economic concepts in an accessible way.     \n\nChapter 5: Wage setting in an unfair world\n\nVarious forms of discrimination contribute towards wage inequality. Experts from Brazil and India introduce discrimination based on gender, race, cast and ethnicity and the how these shape wage levels. Trade unionists from the Global South discuss the challenges of wage setting for migrant workers and workers in precarious employment.    \n\nChapter 6: Workers’ strategies and campaigns for Minimum Wages, Collective Bargaining and Decent Wages\n\nThis chapter aims at drawing lessons for sustainable wages policies and trade union strategies around the world. Workers in different parts of the world are undertaking campaigns for living wages to address social inequalities and to ensure decent jobs.

Learn from top academics, hands-on practitioners, citizens,\nand migrants and refugees in as little as 5 minutes a day.\n\nIncreased diversity in Europe is a problem for some, a cause for celebration for others, and a lived\nreality for many. But while we hear all the time from politicians and media that successful\nintegration is the solution, we have a hunch that we may not all be talking about the same thing.\nIn this course, we’ll be tackling some controversial topics and big ideas related to integration such as\nmulticulturalism, plurality, identity, and belonging from the perspectives of research, praxis, and\npersonal experience. We will examine two case studies: Germany, a country that has seen a recent\nincrease in immigrant arrivals, and Canada, a country that is often seen as a poster child for\nintegration.\n\n\n\nThe two core lecturers for the course, Prof. Dr. Naika Foroutan and Prof. Dr. Irene Bloemraad, are\nforemost experts on integration and managing diversity in Germany and Canada, respectively. They\nare joined by practitioners and social entrepreneurs, volunteers and activists, and migrants and\nrefugees to offer a holistic look at this complex topic.\n\nOur aim is not to cover wide academic territory or provide you with definitive answers. What we\noffer you is a nuanced starting ground from which to begin your own explorations. So, don’t expect\nlong lectures in front of blackboards, homework, or tests. Do expect bite-sized lectures you can\nwatch on your coffee break, a multitude of voices to nourish your mind, and chances to contribute\nyour own voice.\n\nOur course may be bite-sized, but it has one big aim: to empower more evidence-based and\nsolutions-oriented conversations about immigrant integration in Europe today.

Therefore, there will not be an emphasis on proofs (with all the possible technical complications), but rather on how the different notions are related to one another, and how they can be successfully employed to tackle some interesting issues coming from other branches of science.\n\nWho is this course for?\n\nThis is basically a course at the Master Level. Even though the hardest mathematical aspects of the theory will not be dealt with here (for example, for anyone even barely familiar with them, there will be no mention of topologival vector spaces), nevertheless a certain level of mathematical knowledge is a fudamental prerequisite, which cannot be done away with.\n\nWhat do I need to know?\n\nA person interested in this course can take it successfully, provided he/she has already basic proficiency (for example at a bachelor degree level) in Linear Algebra, One-variable Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, Metric and Normed Spaces and their introductory feature.\n\nWhat will I learn?\n\nThe aim of the course is to make the interested student knowledgeable in the basic notions of the Theory of Distributions and its use in concrete applications. Typically, a person working in the field of Electronic Engineering, will be able to apply the tools learned in the course, to address problems coming from Signal Theory. The final chapter of the course can also be seen as an introduction to Partial Differential Equations, paving therefore the way to further mathematical studies for interested people. Finally, the Theory of Distributions is a beautiful piece of Mathematics, and the course is surely a good opportunity also for all those persons who are simply interested in broadening their mathematical knowledge, without an immediate practical aim.\n\nCourse Structure\n\nAs clearly explained above, the course is quite technical, and a satisfactory description of the contents of each unit would be too long. It suffices to say that what we are trying to convey is more or less the following:\n\nFirst chapter: what is all about\nSecond chapter: classical operations can be defined for distributions too, but they require an extra and unexpected care.\nThird chapter: this is a detour, namely a crash course on &quot;classical Fourier transform&quot;, which acts ans an introduction to the next chapter.\nFourth chapter: we give a look at the notion of Fourier transform in the context of distributions.\nFifth chapter: this is something that is quite interesting and important, mainly (but not exclusively) for people interested in Signal Theory.\nSixth chapter: few (very few!) words about the wonderful world of Partial Differential Equations, and how they can be dealt with using distributions.\n\nHere are more technical details about the contents of all the different chapters.\n\nFirst Chapter: A primer about distributions\n\nUnit 1 - Introduction; Definition of the space D(Ω); Definition of distributions\nUnit 2  - The L^1_{loc} space and the notion of convergence\nUnit 3  - Derivatives in the sense of distributions; Convergence in the sense of distributions\nUnit 4  - Completeness of the space of distributions; Simple examples of distributions\n\nSecond Chapter: Main operations with distributions\n\nUnit 1  - Multiplication of a distribution by a C^∞ function; Leibniz’s Formula for the product\nUnit 2  - Composition; Restriction; Tensor Product \nUnit 3  - The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in the context of distributions\nUnit 4  - Support of a distribution; Compactly supported distributions; Extension from D to C^∞\nUnit 5  - Division in the sense of distributions\n\nThird Chapter: Fourier Transforms for functions in L^1 and L^2\n\nUnit 1  - The Fourier Transform in L^1\nUnit 2  - Inversion of the Fourier Transform in L^1\nUnit 3  - The Fourier Transform in L^2\nUnit 4  - Inversion of the Fourier Transform in L^2; Unitary operators\n\nFourth Chapter: Tempered distributions\n\nUnit 1  - Introduction to the space of tempered distributions\nUnit 2  - The Fourier Transform for tempered distributions\nUnit 3  - Simple applications of the Fourier Transform for tempered distributions\n\nFifth Chapter: Convolution\n\nUnit 1  - Convolution between a D function and a D’ distribution\nUnit 2  - Further examples of convolution between a function and a distribution; Convolution between two proper distributions\nUnit 3  - The Theorem of Convolution for the Fourier Transform of tempered distributions\nUnit 4  - The Paley-Wiener Theorem\nUnit 5  - Simple applications of the Paley-Wiener Theorem\n\nSixth Chapter: Applications to Linear Partial Differential Equations\n\nUnit 1  - The fundamental solution of the Laplace equation; An application\nUnit 2  - The fundamental solution of the heat equation; An application\nUnit 3  - The fundamental solution of the wave equation; An application\n","currency_unit":"€","amount":"300/month","instructors":[{"name":"Ugo Gianazza","bio":"Ugo Gianazza is currently Chair of the Department of Mathematics “F.

Doch trotz der großen Einigkeit, dass die Haltung elementar wichtig ist, sind wir doch hier ziemlich unpräzise: Mit welcher Haltung arbeiten wir wirklich? Wie können wir diese Haltung aktiv entwickeln, innerhalb wie außerhalb des Mediationsverfahrens? Dieser Kurs konzentriert sich daher nur auf die inneren Aspekte von Mediation. Was genau passiert in uns? Welchen Verführungen sind wir ausgesetzt? Wie können wir uns aktiv innerlich ausrichten?  \n\nWas lerne ich in diesem Kurs?\n\nDieser Kurs ist organisch entstanden. Zwei Mediatoren, die seit zwanzig Jahren in diesem Feld arbeiten, haben sich monatelang selbst beobachtet, um so präzise wie möglich zu beschreiben, was im Laufe von Mediationen IN ihnen passiert. Aus den Erkenntnissen, die sie von ihrer inneren Forschungsreise mitgebracht haben, sind sieben Kapitel entstanden: der Auftakt der Innenschau; die Verankerung von Basisbegriffen wie Haltung, Interesse oder Lösung; der ganz persönliche, authentische Bezug zu Mediation; innere Modelle, die den Blick immer wieder erweitern; eine innere Ausrichtung auf Verstehen und Beziehung; ein paar Aspekte wie Evolution oder Spiritualität, die vielleicht (nicht) in die Mediation gehören; und ein pragmatischer Ausblick mit Erinnerungsstützen und Honorarfragen. Für die Teilnehmenden ermöglicht dieser transparente Reflexionsprozess eine Vertiefung der eigenen Reflexionsmöglichkeiten und bietet eine große Bandbreite an Theorien und Methoden, die der inneren Ausrichtung dienen. Der Austausch mit anderen Teilnehmenden erweitert diesen Erkundungs- und Entwicklungsprozess als Mediator und Mensch zusätzlich um die inneren Erfahrungen vieler.  \n\nKursstruktur\n\nDieser Kurs besteht aus 21 thematischen kurzen Videos in 7 Kapiteln, die im eigenen Rhythmus (wir empfehlen langsam und reflektiert) angesehen werden können.\nLernen, insbesondere Haltungsentwicklung, findet jedoch mehr durch eigenes Handeln statt. Daher befinden sich in jedem Kapitel drei Aufgaben: eine kontinuierliche Aufgabe, die in jedem Kapitel wiederkehrt und die Zuwendung in die eigene Innenwelt zum Inhalt hat; eine innere Aufgabe, die sich auf die Reflexion eines Themas aus einem Video bezieht; und eine äußere Aufgabe, die den Kontakt mit der Außenwelt erfordert, verbunden mit anschließendem Teilen der gemachten Erfahrung in der Community dieses Kurses. \n\nFür welche Zielgruppe ist dieser Kurs konzipiert?\n\nDieser Kurs wurde für Menschen entwickelt, die als Mediatoren arbeiten bzw. eine fertige Mediationsausbildung haben.\nIm Kern geht es jedoch um innere Aspekte von Professionalität, Haltung und Authentizität und ist daher in größten Teilen auf fast alle Berufsgruppen übertragen – auf jeden Fall auf solche Berufe, die sich mit der Begleitung von Prozessen und der Unterstützung von Menschen befassen.  \n\nWelche Vorkenntnisse benötige ich?\n\nAm meisten profitieren sicher die Menschen, die Mediation bereits gut kennen, da hier keinerlei Basiswissen vermittelt wird. Allerdings konzentriert sich der Kurs so stark auf die inneren Aspekte, dass auch Personen ohne methodisches Know-How von Mediation ihm in den allermeisten Teilen gut folgen können sollten.\n\nWas ist in diesem Kurs enthalten?\n\nIm Kurs enthalten sind sowohl hochwertige Lernvideos und Leseressourcen als auch weiterführende Links (Videos, Literatur, Blogposts etc.) mit Tipps und Tricks rund um das Thema. Im Diskussionsforum und im interaktiven Logbuch können die Teilnehmenden sich zudem austauschen und einander Feedback geben.\n\nNach der Kursanmeldung hast du Zugang zu:  \n\n\nAllen Kursmaterialien (Unterrichtsvideos, Übungen, Materialien, weiterführende Literatur etc.)\nAnspruchsvollen Tests, die Spass machen \nEiner interaktiven Community\n\n\nNach Absolvierung des Kurses erhältst du:\n\n\nEine Teilnahmebestätigung (Statement of Participation)\n\n\nZusätzlich kannst den Zeitplan für die Absolvierung des Kurses selbst bestimmen.

However, making respect for workers’ rights a reality remains a daily struggle for far too many. \n\nThis short online course offers a mix of video lectures, readings, discussion questions and self-learning options to provide you with knowledge and practical skills for using International Labour Standards to promote and defend worker’s rights worldwide. \n\nWhat will I learn\n\nAt the end of the course you will understand the concept behind International Labour Standards, as well as their standard setting process at the International Labour Organisation (ILO).\n\nYou will have a sound overview on the functioning of the ILO supervisory mechanisms and how you can use them to promote and defend workers’ rights in your country or at the international level. You will also have a good understanding of the fundamentals on Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining, as well as the right to strike as a key element for realising workers’ rights. \n\nWhat do I need to know?\n\nNo prior knowledge is required.\n\nCourse Structure\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to International Labour Standards (ILS) \nWhat is the concept behind International Labour Standards? Which types of International Labour Standards exist and how are they set? Which actors are involved and how are they interlinked? This chapter provides an overview on International Labour Standards and lays the foundation for understanding the standard setting mechanisms at the ILO. In particular, we have a close look at the role of trade unions in setting International Labour Standards.\n\nChapter 2: Supervision of International Labour Standards (ILS)\nThis chapter aims at enabling you to understand and use the ILO supervisory mechanisms for the protection of workers’ rights. The elaborate process is illustrated in a concise and hands-on way, and we take you through it step by step. Again, we pay particular attention to what trade unions can do to make effective use of the ILO supervisory mechanisms. \n\nChapter 3: Freedom of Association, Collective Bargaining and the right to strike\nFreedom of Association and Collective Bargaining are ‘enabling rights’ at the heart of decent work. But what is the legal concept of Freedom of Association under Convention 87 and what makes it fundamental to the implementation of International Labour Standards? This chapter also provides you with an overview on the current debate on the right to strike as a key element of Freedom of Association.\n\nLine-up of contributors\n\nBeatriz Vacotto\n\n\nLegal specialist and Coordinator of the Wages, Working Time, Maritime\nand Specific Workers Team, International Labour Standards Department,\nILO\nMain areas of interest: Support to trade unions on issues related to\nInternational Labour Standards and the ILO supervisory mechanisms.\n\n\nJeffrey Vogt\n\n\nLegal Director, International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC)\nMain areas of interest: trade and labour standards, freedom of\nassociation, precarious work, comparative labour law\n\n\nProf. Dr. Stefanie Lorenzen\n\n\nProfessor of Employment and Labour Law at the Berlin School of\nEconomics and Law, Department of Business and Economics, Germany\nAuthor of the video lectures on Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining of this course\nMain areas of interest: employment law, co-determination, right to\ncollective bargaining, international and European labour law\n\n\nProf. Paul Whitehead\n\n\nProfessor of Practice in Labor Studies and Employment Relations at\nPenn State University, USA\nMain areas of interest: Trade unions, collective bargaining, labor\nand employment law, international labor law, international human\nresources, trade law, and programs for pensions, health care, and\nsocial security\n\n\nMaité Llanos\n\n\nInternational project coordinator, Global Labour University\nGlobal Labour University Online tutor\n\n\nTandiwe Gross\n\n\nAssociate Expert at the Bureau for Workers’ Activities, ILO\nInternational coordinator of the Global Labour University’s Online Education Programs\n\n\nCourse Options\n\nAudit Track (for free)\n\n\nNo requirements\nOptional Statement of Participation (19 €)\n\n\nFor obtaining your Statement of Participation in the Audit Track, you need to complete 80% of the video lectures and quizzes.

Тем не менее, нарушения прав человека в сфере труда широко распространены во всем мире: каждый день миллионы людей сталкиваются с эксплуататорской продолжительностью рабочего времени, нищенскими зарплатами, унижением и плохим обращением на рабочем месте. \nВместе с экспертами из Беларуси, России и Украины международная команда Глобального университета труда разработала этот Массовый открытый онлайн-курс (МООC) по правам трудящихся. В данном курсе обсуждается, что такое международные права трудящихся, а также те инструменты и стратегии, которые могут быть использованы для их реализации. На основе тщательного сочетания видео-лекций, материалов для чтения, интернет-ресурсов и интервью с активистами и экспертами в сфере труда из разных стран, вы получите знания и практические навыки для дальнейшего продвижения прав трудящихся.     \n\nРегистрация\nЧтобы записаться на этот курс, сначала вы должны зарегестрироваться на учебной платформе iversity.org.  Нажмите на клавишу &quot;sign up&quot;, расположенную в верхней части этой страницы. Вам нужно будет заполнить краткую форму, указав имя, фамилию, адрес электронной почты и ввести пароль для авторизации. После этого вы получите сообщение от iversity, в котором вам будет нужно подтвердить ваш адрес электронной почты, нажав на  ссылку в тексте сообщения. Пожалуйста, проверьте также папку со спамом. После того как вы зарегистрируетесь, вы сможете войти на   iversity.org, указав вашу электронную почту и пароль, и  начать курс.  \n\nЧему я научусь?\n\nК концу курса вы ознакомитесь с концепцией международных трудовых норм и их практическим применением, ознакомитесь с концепциями таких основополагающих прав как свобода объединения и ведение коллективных переговоров, будете понимать институциональную структуру Международной организации труда (МОТ) - ключевого игрока в установлении международных трудовых норм. Вы сможете присоединиться к экономической дискуссии об установлении минимальной заработной платы, научитесь определять типы дискриминации и противостоять им.     \n\nЧто мне необходимо знать?\n\nВ теоретическую основу данного курса заложены знания в области политологии, экономики и права на уровне, соответствующем уровню магистратуры. Однако, теоретические концепции представлены в доступной для понимания форме и хорошо проиллюстрированы, поэтому участвовать в обучении можно используя знания и навыки, приобретенные и за пределами специального профессионального образования. \n\nУчебная платформа Iversity, на которой размещен курс, является международной. Поэтому навигационное меню платформы оформлено на английском языке. Для того, чтобы вам было удобнее пользоваться меню курса - был разработан специальный подробный глоссарий.    \n\nСтруктура курса\n\nМодуль 1: Введение в международные трудовые нормы\nКаковы типы международных трудовых норм и как они устанавливаются? Кто основные участники этого процесса и как они взаимодействуют между собой? В этом модуле представлен обзор международных трудовых норм МОТ, а также заложена основа для понимания механизма их установления.   \n\nМодуль 2: Контроль за соблюдением международных трудовых норм\nДанный модуль предназначен для ознакомления с контрольным механизмом МОТ и способами его использования для защиты прав трудящихся. Этот сложный процесс представлен в краткой и удобной форме, и дополнен практической информацией от экспертного сообщества.   \n\nПо завершении модуля вам будет предложено выполнить промежуточное задание и применить полученные знания для анализа практического случая из вашей страны.  Задание должно быть выполнено к моменту завершения Модуля 3, а затем прорецензировано вашими однокурсниками. Метод взаимного рецензирования позволит вам учиться друг у друга и углубить знания о ситуации в других странах.     \n\nМодуль 3: Свобода объединения, коллективные переговоры и право на забастовку\nСвобода объединения и коллективные переговоры - это «неотъемлемые права», лежащие в основе достойного труда. Но в чем заключается правовая концепция свободы объединения согласно Конвенции №87, и почему она является фундаментальной для соблюдения международных трудовых норм? В этом  модуле также рассказывается о существующей полемике вокруг права на забастовку, представлены материалы, иллюстрирующие примеры реализации права на свободу объединения и на ведение коллективных переговоров.    \n\nМодуль 4: Дискриминация в сфере труда\nКакие виды дискриминации существуют в сфере труда? Какие инструменты МОТ следует использовать, чтобы противостоять дискриминации и отстаивать равенство на рабочем месте? В данном модуле обсуждаются проблемы гендерной дискриминации, дискриминации в связи с членством профсоюзе, дискриминации по отношению к работникам-мигрантам. Основной лекционный материал дополнен примерами успешного опыта борьбы профсоюзов из разных стран.   \n\nМодуль 5: Минимальная заработная плата\nВ этом модуле представлена концепция минимальной заработной платы как одного из прав человека, рассматриваются инструменты МОТ по  установлению минимальной заработной платы и обсуждается ее экономическая роль и проблемы эффективного применения.   \n\nЗаключительный экзамен ( письменный тест)\nСтуденты, выбравшие сертифицированный курс, будут иметь неделю на подготовку к экзамену по материалам обучения. Экзамен будет проходить в форме теста с множественным выбором ответа.    \n\nКоманда курса\n\nЕлена Герасимова (Заведующая кафедрой трудового права и права социального обеспечения факультета права, Национальный исследовательский университет “Высшая школа экономики”, Россия)\nПавло Кутуев (Профессор, заведующий кафедрой социологии Национального технического университета Украины «Киевский политехнический институт» имени  Игоря Сикорского, Украина)\nАнна Андреева (Специалист по политическим вопросам и кампаниям Интернационала работников строительства и деревообработки (BWI)\nОксана Балашова (Международный центр для развития и достойного труда при университете Касселя, Германия)\nАрина Граженская (Координатор проекта, тьютор учебного курса, Глобальный университет труда)\nЗахар Попович (Центр социальных и трудовых исследований, Украина)\nФранк Хоффер (Специалист по исследовательской работе Бюро по деятельности трудящихся, МОТ; Международный координатор Глобального университета труда)  \n\nМеждународные эксперты и соавторы курса\n\nПол Уайтхед (Профессор Университета штата Пенсильвания, США)\nАвтор материалов видео-лекций Модуля 1 “Введение в международные трудовые нормы”\nБеатрис Вакотто (Департамент по международным трудовым нормам, МОТ) Автор материалов видео-лекций Модуля 2 “Контроль за соблюдением международных трудовых норм”\nСтефани Лоренцен (Профессор Берлинской школы экономики и права, Германия) Автор материалов видео-лекций Модуля 3 “Свобода объединения, коллективные переговоры и право на забастовку”\nДжеффри Вогт (Директор по правовым вопросам Международной конфедерации профсоюзов (МКП)\nАлександр Ярошук (Председатель Белорусского конгресса демократических профсоюзов (БКДП), Беларусь)\nВасиль Андреев (Председатель профсоюза работников строительства и промышленности строительных материалов Украины, Украина)\nПетр Тулей (Заместитель председателя Конфедерации свободных профсоюзов Украины, председатель Киевского городского объединения КСПУ, Украина)\nМихаил Чесалин (Председатель профсоюза работников наемного труда Калининградской области «Трудовые бригады», Россия)\nЕлена Еськова (Национальный юрист БКДП, Беларусь)\nЛизавета Мерляк (Специалист по международной работе, Белорусский Независимый профсоюз, Беларусь)\nОлеся Брязгунова (Менеджер по связям с общественностью, Конфедерация свободных профсоюзов Украины, Украина)\nВениамин Тимошенко (Председатель независимого профсоюза бортпроводников авиокомпании “АэроСвит”, Украина)\nНина Потарская (Директор Центра социальных и трудовых исследований, Украина)\nСергей Стынко (Председатель первичной профсоюзной организации Всеукраинского профсоюза “Защита справедливости” Измаильского морского торгового порта, Украина)\nКатерина Ярмолюк-Крьок (Глобальный университет труда)\nМихаил Ромась (Председатель Свободного профсоюза студентов, Киевский национальный университет имени Тараса Шевченко, Украина)  \n\nImage Copyright (above): Принев П. / КТР \n","currency_unit":"€","amount":"300/month","instructors":[{"name":"Елена Герасимова","bio":"Елена Герасимова закончила юридический факультет Московского государственного университета имени М.В.

Governed by powerful transnational corporations, these global supply chains set the ‘rules of the game’ of today’s global production system. For the majority of workers, this production system translates into poverty wages, excessive working hours, unsafe workplaces and repression of workers’ right to form and join democratic trade unions.\nThis course offers a careful mix of video lectures and interviews, readings, online resources, and exercises to gain both knowledge and practical skills for promoting decent work in global supply chains. In some countries, the online learning experience will be complemented with local workshops for a truly global learning experience. \n\nThe course started with a Facebook live discussion with Prof. Dr. Mark Anner on 12 January 2017. You can see the recording here \n\nThis is a free self-paced course in which you can study at your own pace. You can enrol for free in the audit track and - if you wish - get a Statement of Participation for 29 € once you&#39;ve finished the course. \nOnce per year, we will offer the option to get a Certificate for 49 € after passing an online exam. The Global Labour University may offer scholarships to participants from non-OECD countries to do a Certificate for free. If you wish to get a Certificate for this course, please start studying in the audit track and you will be informed about the next exam period and the scholarship option.\n\nIf you work for a university, trade union or any other labour-related institution you are welcome to integrate the course material into your education and training programmes. All video lectures and interviews, readings, online resources, and exercises can be downloaded separately and used for free.\n\nWhat will I learn\n\nThis course discusses the particularities and strategies of transnational corporations as actors orchestrating global supply chains, as well as their impact on labour relations worldwide. It looks at regulatory frameworks for trade, investment and taxation, and explores whether global supply chains contribute to development. \nAfter presenting the major decent work gaps in today’s global supply chains, the course will look at the existing governance framework and its gaps.  What are the governance gaps and what are strategies and tools for an alternative governance structure that promotes sustainable development and decent work in global supply chains? \n\nWhat do I need to know?\n\nThe course requires a working level of English and draws on the fields of political science and law at the level of a Masters’ programme. However, theoretical concepts are explained in an accessible and well-illustrated way, so it is also possible to participate in the course using skills and knowledge acquired outside formal education.\n\nCourse Structure\n\nYou can study at your own pace- any time you want. The estimated workload is 3-4 hours per week.   \n\nChapter 1: Introduction to global supply chains\n This chapter introduces the evolution and drivers of global supply chains as today’s dominant production system. It discusses whether the “East-Asian miracle” countries can serve as an example for development through global supply chains and explores the architecture and strategies of transnational corporations. Participants will be invited to introduce themselves and share relevant material in an interactive world map.\n\nChapter 2: The regulatory framework on trade, investment and taxation \nChapter two provides an overview of the evolution and characteristics of the global trade system and the framework of investment and taxation. Who sets the rules? How does dispute settlement work in today’s trade regime? What are the implications of these rules for human and workers’ rights, social justice and the environment?  \n\nChapter 3: Global supply chains and development\n This chapter discusses the role of global wage hierarchies and investment policies as drivers of global supply chains and explores their impact on development. What can we learn from the example of the extractive industries in Africa, and from the impact of privatization on public services? In which way do global supply chains rely on forced and child labour. How does insertion into global supplies chains affect middle-income countries?\n\nChapter 4: Decent work gaps in global supply chains \nFeaturing the ITUC’s general secretary Sharan Burrow, this chapter explores the different levels of decent work gaps in global supply chains. It looks at the fragmentation of labour and the realities of informal economy workers at the bottom of many global supply chains.  \n\nChapter 5: Key elements of the existing governance framework\nHow are global supply chains governed today? What are the main instruments of Corporate Social Responsibility, what do the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights say and how does the complaints mechanism under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises work? Given the existence of these mechanisms, why do massive workers’ rights violations in global supply chains continue?\n\nChapter 6: Negotiated governance - strategies on the company and industry level\n This chapter explores innovative strategies on the company and industry level to improve working conditions and voice and representation of workers, including Global Framework Agreements, the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety and IndustriALL’s ACT Initiative. What can we learn from them and how can they be extended?\n\nChapter 7: Regulating global supply chains - strategies on the political and legal level\nWhat are the most promising political and legal strategies to realize decent work in global supply chains? This chapter combines the voices of international experts from the policy and legal fields and looks at the most common arguments of employers against the regulation of global supply chains. It closes with an overview of the way forward.\n\nChapter 8: Campaigning to win – strategies and tools\nEven the best knowledge is useless without the right tools to push for change. Drawing on successful campaigns, this chapter explains the key methods and tools of strategic corporate research and campaigning as well as hands-on skills on how to use technology and communication to promote decent work in global supply chains. \n\nStudy time if you have decided to participate in the exam  \n\nCourse options\n\nAudit Track (for free) \n\n\nNo requirements\noptional Statement of Participation (29 €)\n\n\nFor obtaining your Statement of Participation in the Audit Track, you need to complete 80% of the video lectures and quizzes.

Il est conçu autour d&#39;une idée simple : la vision &quot;en directe&quot; des manuscrits, car les lessons se déroulent au sein même des bibliothèques qui conservent ces objets rares,  exclus d&#39;habitude de la consultation. Les livres sont ainsi montrés et feuilletés devant la caméra, leurs pages enluminées commentées afin d&#39;illustrer les enjeux de leur iconographie, profane, religieuse ou politique. Des images de comparaison, illustrant les personnages évoqués, ou d&#39;autres manuscrits et tableaux de la même époque, permettent de mieux situer ces livres dans leur contexte historique et artistique.   \n\nQue vais-je apprendre?\n\nLe cours s&#39;adresse à toute personne intéressée à l&#39;histoire de l&#39;art et à l&#39;histoire de la Renaissance.  \n\nStructure du cours\n\nChapitre I.

L&#39;analyse de leur programme iconographique révèle, d&#39;un côté, les revendications dynastiques des ducs et, de l&#39;autre, l&#39;organisation d&#39;un livre richissime d&#39;images destinées à la dévotion.  \n\nII.1.

Et comment peut-on rendre hommage aux rois et aux princes ? Ce chapitre répond en étudiant l&#39;iconographie d&#39;un livre d&#39;heures offert à Charles VIII, roi de France, celle d&#39;un Missel illustrant l&#39;investiture ducale (où se reflète la présence à la cour de Léonard de Vinci), enfin un recueil de poèmes teinté de pourpre offert à la Duchesse Beatrice d&#39;Este.  \n\nIV.1.

Who built it? How was it built? Why was it built? Answers cannot be promised to all of these, but we can get better at asking the questions and work towards solutions. We can look at how people have responded to Stonehenge. Most of all we can begin to think about what Stonehenge means to us.\nThis MOOC is offered by The University of Buckingham (UK), which is supporting the Blick Mead Stonehenge archaeological dig (project leader Professor David Jacques). The University’s Stonehenge speciality is reflected in an MA by research (taught in London) on archaeology and Stonehenge.\nYour MOOC tutor is Professor Graeme Davis, University of Buckingham, who combines enthusiasm for archaeology and Stonehenge with subject speciality in the humanities and linguistics.  \n\nWhat do I learn?\n\n\nTo understand present archaeological thinking about Stonehenge.\nTo evaluate responses to Stonehenge in art, literature, music, architecture and culture.\nTo consider your own response to Stonehenge and reflect through a Journal.\n\n\nAdditionally students have an opportunity to develop a connection with the University of Buckingham. We want to get to know you!\n\nWhat do I need too know?\n\nNo entry requirements. This MOOC is open to all. The materials are a spur to your own investigation and can be studied at a variety of academic levels. Students whose first language is not English are welcome to this MOOC, and may find particularly useful the work on Stonehenge as a part of British culture.  \n\nCourse Structure\n\nChapter 1: Stonehenge: Landscape and Context \nStonehenge as a landscape of prehistoric sites. The chronological context: the Mesolithic, the Neolithic and the building of the Stonehenge.  \n\nChapter 2: The Stonehenge Questions\n The big Stonehenge questions: When? By whom? How? and Why? The wider context of the Stonehenge Landscape.  \n\nChapter 3: Historians and Archaeologists\n Reactions to Stonehenge from Geoffrey of Monmouth through the antiquarian tradition to the modern archaeological response.  \n\nChapter 4: Cultural Contexts \nStonehenge in fiction, poetry, music, art and popular culture.  \n\nChapter 5: Stonehenge Today\n Stonehenge as a cultural icon, emblem of Britain, World Heritage site and sacred space. Blick Mead as the cradle of Stonehenge.   \n\n\nThroughout the emphasis is on your response. This course looks at the archaeological response, at responses through history, and the cultural responses.\nOn completion students are offered a Statement of Participation.\n\n\nWorkload\n\nWorkload can be varied to suit individuals. A guide is to look at the MOOC over five weeks at a chapter a week, and allow around two hours per week. However there are many additional ideas presented for you to use in exploring Stonehenge, including reading novels and listening to symphonies. Maybe you will want to visit Stonehenge, or talk with us about visiting our Blick Mead dig. Maybe you will want to compare Stonehenge with a monument in your vicinity. Of course, students who want to skim the materials can do just this.

Kleine, wendige Unternehmen ändern immer häufiger die Spielregeln ganzer Industrien und bringen tradierte Geschäftsfelder ebenso wie gewohnte Vorgehensweisen ins Wanken.\nGerade erfahrene Unternehmen und ihre Führungskräfte stehen damit vor einer großen Herausforderung, denn die Darwin’schen Regeln der Evolution gelten auch für die digitalisierte Welt: Survival of the fittest. Wie in der Biologie gilt auch in der Wirtschaft: Nicht Stärke sichert die eigene Spezies, sondern Anpassungsfähigkeit.\nAnpassung und Kundenorientierung sind Kernthemen des Agilen Managements. Der Umgang mit komplexen Situationen in sich rasch wandelnden Märkten erfordert an vielen Stellen, immer wieder neu zu entscheiden, welcher Weg am ehesten zum Ziel führt.\n  \n\nIn diesem Kurs lernst du, dein Unternehmen, dein Team und deine Projekte fit zu machen für unsichere Zeiten:     \n\n•    Wie verkürzt man Entwicklungszyklen und bleibt reaktionsfähig, auch wenn sich Rahmenbedingungen ändern?\n  •    Wie entwickelt man Produkte und Services, die beim Kunden ankommen?\n  •    Wie validiert man Geschäftsmodelle, noch bevor sie in die Umsetzung gehen?\n  •    Wie schafft man eine Unternehmenskultur, die Innovation zu einer gemeinsamen Aufgabe macht und was bedeutet das für dich als Führungskraft und in Projektteams?    \n\nDidaktik und Kursstruktur\n\nLernen soll Spaß machen. Daher nimmt dich dieser Kurs mit in eine fiktive Unternehmenswelt, in der dir manches vielleicht bekannt vorkommen wird. Du wirst dafür verantwortlich sein, ein Projekt dieses Unternehmens Schritt für Schritt vor dem Scheitern zu retten und eine Produktinnovation agil auf den Weg zu bringen.  \n\nIn jedem Kapitel erlernst du die theoretischen und methodischen Grundlagen, die du dann auf dein eigenes Kursprojekt anwenden wirst. Filmszenen, Case Studys und Übungsaufgaben machen die Theorie erlebbar und helfen, sie in den beruflichen Kontext zu transferieren.  \n\nDer Kurs kann sowohl als reiner Online-Kurs zum Selbstlernen sowie optional im Blended-Learning-Format mit Begleitung durch unsere Trainer vor Ort oder ortsunabhängig im virtuellen Klassenraum belegt werden. Gerne machen wir dir für die Optionen ein individuelles Angebot.\n\nKapitel 1 - Management im digitalen Zeitalter\n\n\nStrategische Relevanz: Der Kontext, warum die Digitalisierung Unternehmen dazu zwingt, alte Denkweisen zu verändern und einen Paradigmenwechsel vorzunehmen\nScheitern von Innovationen: Lerne zu analysieren, warum Projekte scheitern und zu reflektieren, welche Änderungen zum Erfolg beitragen können\nDas Kursprojekt: Lerne das fiktive Projekt kennen, dass du im Verlauf des Kurses durch neue Herangehensweisen vor dem Scheitern bewahren sollst.\n\n\nKapitel 2 - Grundprinzipien des Agilen Managements\n\n\nDas neue Paradigma: Kundenzentrisches Entwickeln, ganzheitliches Denken und iteratives Vorgehen als Grundprinzipien des Agilen Managements\nInnovations- und Entscheidungstheorie: Lerne zu beurteilen, welches Vorgehensmodell unter bestimmten Rahmenbedingungen das geeignete ist\nAgile Methoden: Verschaffe dir sich einen Überblick über gängige agile Methoden wie Scrum, Design Thinking und Lean Startup sowie ihre Eigenheiten und Unterschiede\n\n\nKapitel 3 - Agile Methoden\n\n\nAbgrenzung Agiler Methoden zum klassischen Wasserfall-Vorgehen\nAgile Methoden: Lerne SCRUM, Lean Production, Kanban, Lean Startup, Customer Development, Business Modell Generation und Design Thinking näher kennen\n\n\nKapitel 4 - Kundenbedürfnisse verstehen\n\n\nCustomer Research: Lerne Kunden zu befragen, um Bedürfnisse zu verstehen und Potentiale abzuleiten\nValue Proposition Design: Lerne die Customer Insights zu strukturieren und systematisch Komponenten für dein Produkt/ deine Dienstleistung abzuleiten\nDeine Idee: Entwickele eine eigene Idee für dein Kursprojekt basierend auf deinem Customer Research\n\n\nKapitel 5 - Geschäftsmodellierung\n\n\nBusiness Model vs. Businessplan: Unterscheide zwischen einem Business Model, einem Business Plan und einem Business Case, um die richtige Flughöhe für deine Themen finden zu können\nBusiness Model Generation: Lerne auf einfache Weise ganzheitliche Geschäftsmodelle zu skizzieren, welche die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette berücksichtigen\nDein Geschäftsmodell: Entwickele anhand der Methodik ein eigenes Geschäftsmodell für dein Produkt oder deine Dienstleistung\n\n\nKapitel 6 - Validierung von Annahmen\n\n\nEvidenzbasiertes Management: Lerne wie die Unterscheidung zwischen annahmenbasierter und evidenzbasierter Vorgehensweise dabei helfen kann, frühzeitig Risiken zu minimieren\nKritische Annahmen: Lerne kritische Annahmen in einem Geschäftsmodell zu identifizieren und gemäß ihres Risiko-potentials zu priorisieren\nBusiness Experimentation: Verschaffe dir einen Überblick über verschiedene experimentelle Methoden, um niedrig-schwellig kritische Annahmen zu überprüfen und schnelle iterative Verbesserungen vorzunehmen\nDein Experiment: Führe dein eigenes Experiment durch, um einen Aspekt deines Geschäftsmodells zu überprüfen\n\n\nKapitel 7 - Transfer in den Unternehmensalltag\n\n\nCase Study „Agile Entwicklung“: Anhand eines realen Beispiels zeigen wir dir, wie sich ein Geschäftsmodell durch gezieltes Experimentieren über mehrere Iterationsphasen hinweg verändern kann\nErfahrungsberichte: Wir lassen Praktiker zu Wort kommen, die mithilfe agiler Methoden wesentliche Innovationen in ihrem Unternehmen vorangebracht haben und lassen sie ihre Erfahrungen mit dir teilen\nDer Schritt in die Wirklichkeit: Reflektiere deine Rolle, Einsatzmöglichkeiten und potentiellen Hürden bei der Einführung der gelernten Methoden in deinem Unternehmen oder Projekt. Plane deine nächsten Schritte für den Einsatz agiler Methoden im Geschäftsalltag.\n\n\nFür welche Zielgruppe ist dieser Kurs konzipiert?\n\nDer Kurs richtet sich an Menschen, die Projektmanagement und Teambuilding im digitalen Zeitalter klassen- und branchenübergreifend erfolgreich bewerkstelligen müssen, aber vor allem an folgende Personengruppen:  \n\n\nOberste Führungsebene, die wichtige Unternehmensentscheidungen sowie die Erarbeitung umsatzgetriebener Strategien verantwortet.\nMittlere und untere Managementebene, die das Ziel hat verantwortungsvollere höhere Positionen zu erlangen.\nAlle Produktmanager, die ihre Prozesse kundenzentriert aufbauen wollen.\nUnternehmer, die ein Unternehmen im digitalen Bereich aufbauen oder deren Geschäftsmodell auf digitaler Kommunikation basiert.\nAlle, die sich beruflich verändern möchten und digitale Produkte und Prozesse steuern möchte.\n\n\nWelche Vorkenntnisse benötige ich?\n\nInhaltliche Vorkenntnisse sind nicht erforderlich.

Si procede esaminando il ruolo chiave che, inaspettatamente, la pila ebbe nell&#39;aprire gli interi nuovi domini dell&#39;elettrochimica, dell&#39;elettromagnetismo e delle loro fondamentali ricadute teoriche e applicative. Il corso si sofferma infine sull’eredità scientifica più attuale di Volta indicando come l’elettricità di contatto – che egli ipotizza sin dalle prime fasi dei dibattiti che lo conducono alla pila e che in suo onore oggi si chiama “effetto Volta” – interviene in tecnologie avanzate come il foto(volta)ico e l’illuminazione a LED.  Insieme alle idee, il corso considera anche il ruolo molto importante degli strumenti, sfruttando a questo scopo le potenzialità offerte dalle collezioni storiche custodite nelle strutture museali dell’Università di Pavia.  \n\nObiettivi formativi\n\nAcquisire conoscenze di primo livello accurate sugli argomenti proposti e corrispondente sviluppo di capacità di giudizio critico di fronte a materiali didattici, divulgativi o anche specialistici dedicati agli stessi temi.

Dal 2008 presta servizio come professore di II fascia confermato presso lo stesso Dipartimento, tenendo i corsi principali di Storia della Fisica e Museologia Scientifica. Ha tenuto anche svariati corsi di Storia della Fisica nell&#39;ambito della S.I.L.S.I.S. per la formazione dei docenti di scuola superiore.\nDall’anno accademico 2011-2012 tiene il corso di Storia della Fisica per l’Insegnamento nell’ ambito del TFA (Tirocinio Formativo Attivo) per la formazione degli insegnanti della Scuola Media Superiore.\nDal 2012 è Presidente del Consiglio Direttivo della S.I.S.F.A. (Società Italiana degli Storici della Fisica e dell&#39;Astronomia) e in precedenza è stato membro del Consiglio Direttivo della stessa Società. Gli interessi e le attività scientifiche si incentrano sulla storia della scienza italiana ed europea tra la seconda metà del Settecento e la prima metà dell’Ottocento.\nPrevalente è stato l’interesse per la figura di Alessandro Volta, non solo in relazione all’elettricità, ma anche alla chimica e al contesto fisiologico entro cui si svolse il dibattito sull’elettricità animale con i sostenitori di Galvani e da cui alla fine emerse la sua grande invenzione della pila. Si è impegnato in una ricostruzione del pensiero fisico di Volta, mettendo in discussione una serie di interpretazioni stabilizzate che mostrano i segni del tempo e varie inadeguatezze storiografiche, tra cui soprattutto l’interpretazione (esplicita o implicita) dell&#39;elettricità voltiana alla luce dell’elettrostatica moderna. Ha fatto in questo senso vedere come i punti di riferimento di Volta fossero principalmente B. Franklin, G.B. Beccaria e R. Boscovich, e non F. Aepinus o H. Cavendish, che furono gli iniziatori degli schemi dell’elettrostatica moderna, o peggio le formulazioni successivamente sviluppate a partire dai loro semi. \nQuesti risultati sono elaborati in varie pubblicazioni, in cui si dà anche ampio ruolo al collegamento tra le teorie e gli strumenti di Volta. Le competenze acquisite nel settore degli studi voltiani gli sono state riconosciute assegnandogli la voce &quot;Volta&quot; nei volumi di aggiornamento del prestigioso &quot;Dictionary of Scientific Biography&quot;. Ha inoltre contribuito agli studi voltiani nella veste di coeditore scientifico della serie &quot;Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and his Times&quot;, specificata nella lista delle pubblicazioni. Attualmente contribuisce all&#39;Edizione Nazionale delle Opere di Ruggero Boscovich occupandosi degli estesi commenti e note che questo autore produsse per l&#39;ampio poema scientifico newtoniano &quot;Philosophia recentioris&quot; di Benedetto Stay.\nAltri settori di ricerca sono la fisica molecolare di P.S. Laplace e la sua ricezione in Italia, la\nteoria della conduzione elettrica di G.S. Ohm in relazione alle teorie della conduzione termica di P.S. Laplace e J. Fourier. Si è occupato anche di Stefano Marianini, interessante figura di fisico ottocentesco, scrivendo la relativa voce per il &quot;Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani&quot;. Ha anche svolto una intensa attività nel campo della progettazione scientifica e allestimento di mostre nazionali e internazionali di storia della scienza. Nel 2005 è stato il responsabile scientifico della sezione di storia della fisica classica nell&#39;ambito della mostra su al Albert Einstein, tenutasi a Pavia e organizzata in collaborazione con il &quot;Max-Planck Institut&quot; di Berlino.\nNel 2006 è stato co-organizzatore e responsabile scientifico della mostra &quot;The Legacy of Volta: From the Battery to Photovoltaic Electricity&quot;, tenutasi in Cina, alla &quot;Tongji University&quot; di Shanghai. Nel 2007 è stato co-organizzatore e corresponsabile scientifico della mostra &quot;Medicine and Life Sciences in Pavia and Bologna&quot;, tenutasi in Cina, al &quot;China Museum of Science and Technology&quot; di Pechino e alla &quot;Tongji University&quot; di Shanghai.

Serão exploradas diferentes abordagens de desenho com a aplicação de diferentes técnicas e materiais. \n\nComo material de suporte serão usados cadernos para Diário Gráfico de formato A4 e A5. Serão exploradas técnicas alternativas de desenho para Diário Gráfico como por exemplo o uso de café e lápis e canetas aguareláveis. Serão exploradas técnicas bidimensionais e tridimensionais, a criação de volume e o uso de perspetiva.\n\nO curso segue uma metodologia baseada no experimentar fazer. O modelo pedagógico do curso foi definido com o intuito de derrubar as barreiras iniciais ao desenho e os medos associados ao “gostava mas não sei”. Os diferentes exercícios apresentados em vídeo em tempo real de produção do desenho permitem uma maior compreensão do desenho enquanto aplicação de técnicas aprendíveis e não como fruto de um “dom” que só poucos têm. Desafiamos todos os que gostariam de desenhar a participar neste curso.\n\nRequisitos\n\nO curso de Desenho para Diário Gráfico não tem pré-requisitos. Partimos do princípio que todas as pessoas podem aprender a desenhar se assim o quiserem. Deste modo, o curso destina-se a todos os interessados em aprender as técnicas e regras mais comuns aplicadas ao desenho para diários gráficos.\n\nAlunos têm ainda a possibilidade de comprar o Statement of Participation (no valor de 29€).

That’s great! Germany is among the most attractive destinations for international young professionals. An abundance of opportunities awaits a well-prepared candidate, and ceasing yours is much easier if you know the ins and outs of the German job market and work culture.\n\nThis MOOC enhances some key skills that you will need for a successful transition from studies to employment. In the seven-week course, you will learn about the German job market, career identities and strategies, job application skills, workplace competences and the psychology of employability. You will also create your personal career development plan to give you immediate guidance for your next steps.\n\nReady to change your backpack into a briefcase? Enrol on our employability skills MOOC today!\n\nWho should take this course?\n\nThe primary audience of this course is international postgraduate level students of engineering or business, but all students may benefit from the learning. \n\nWhat do I need to know and what will I learn?\n\nNo prior knowledge is required.\nAfter completing the MOOC, you will be familiar with many crucial employability skills in particular in the German context. Thus, you will be more prepared when applying for jobs and able to turn a job opportunity into career success in Germany.\n\nCourse Structure\n\nChapter 1 - Introduction. In the first chapter, you will meet the instructors, gain an overview of the course. You will also learn what employability means and how higher education develops it. After the first week, we will also offer a free webinar about getting your career started as a foreign graduate in Germany.\n\nChapter 2 - Career identity. Your career identity means the understanding of self on the labour market. This is determined by various factors such as your competences, motivations and values. In this chapter, you will learn how understanding and reflecting such factors can form a coherent career identity and help you toward greater self-confidence.\n\nChapter 3 - Job application skills. This chapter will give you an overview of the German job market and a variety of skills in identifying job opportunities, writing your application documents and carrying out an effective job application process. You will also gain free CV and cover letter templates in English and German.\n\nChapter 4 - Workplace Analysis. Daily work within an organisation is different in every country. The contents of this chapter guide you in analysing the structures and interpersonal aspects of your workplace in order to make integration easier and improve your performance early on. \n\nChapter 5 - Psychology of Employability. Employability is often linked to the psychology of self. How well you tackle workplace challenges and develop professionally significantly depends on your attitudes, efficacy beliefs and self-confidence. This chapter will discuss the meaning of these concepts to your personal employability. \n\nChapter 6 - Career development project. The course also involves a career development project assignment. If you sign up for the certificate track, completing the assignment is a passing criterion; otherwise completing it is voluntary but useful. Chapter 6 will focus on supporting the project by providing advice and answering learner questions.\n\nChapter 7 - Evaluation and goodbye. Our course is now over and it is time to look back at how we did. At this point, your feedback would be very much appreciated and helpful in improving the course. The certificate track students will receive a personal review appointment by one of the team members at this point.\n","currency_unit":"€","amount":"300/month","instructors":[{"name":"Antti Kapanen","bio":"Thanks for viewing my profile on iversity!

But who provides these bodies with the information they need and shows them the strategic options they have? Who frames political action before the wider public even takes notice of the issue? How does political agenda setting work and what do certain policy outcomes tell us about the future of the issue at stake?  \n\nThis course is designed to outline key features of policy advice and political consulting and their impact on governance.\nWe will observe the key players on the spot as well as those behind the scenes and we will analyze their patterns of interaction. Moreover, we will provide insights regarding essential questions to which there are no single right answers: What role does policy advice play in different democracies? What is good policy advice? What makes an expert? In sum: Whom do (and should) politicians and society listen to, and what do (and should) they make of the advice they receive?\n\nWhat will I learn?\n\nBy the end of the course, students will know the key concepts of policy advice as well as the main actors in the field and their patterns of interaction. They will understand how and by whom a certain political decision is framed, shaped and implemented. And they will be able to apply this knowledge to a given political event which may affect their own professional or personal life. So, first and foremost, they will be able to ask the right questions.\n\nWhat do I need to know?\n\nThe course is designed to cater for students and professionals interested in decision-making, political communication, policy advice and consulting. Course participants are expected to follow current politics and be keen on looking at the matter from different (and sometimes unusual) perspectives.

Advances in technology, data and analytics make it possible to help these customers by offering the right product, while providing the service they expect. Companies are increasingly looking for ways to use data in order to deliver the right kind of products, offers and services to the most valuable customers.   \n\nThis course will provide you with insights into predictive modelling and its applications in commerce. Applying predictive analytics can help your company grow and increase their marketing performance. By the end of this course, you will feel confident to apply predictive analytics resulting in an increase in customer satisfaction, company performance and even team performance.   \n\nWhat will I learn during this course?\n\nThis course will teach you how to identify situations in which predictive analytics can add value by better meeting customer needs, smarter allocation of marketing budgets and improving the financial performance of the company.   \n\nYou will know when to use the following modelling techniques and understand their pros and cons:\n• Logistic regression\n• Decision tree\n• Random forest  \n\nIn the end, you will be able to apply all learned theory into practice and start building a more data-driven culture within your organisation.    \n\n\n\nChapter 1: The Power of Predictive Analytics in Commerce\n\n‘Data Scientist’ was recently called the sexiest job of the 21st century, and we believe that is true. The availability of data is exponentially growing and data analytics is at the heart of many successful companies. We will provide you with examples and inspiration on predictive analytics and convince you of its power in commerce.  \n\nChapter 2: Cross-Selling to the Right Customer\n\nCross-selling is the strategy of matching needs of current customers with product offerings. Since targeting all your current customers with your product is neither efficient nor desirable, this chapter will show you how logistic regression as a modelling technique can be used to select customers with the highest cross-sell potential. \n\nChapter 3: Providing the Next Best Offer\n\nMaking a personalised product proposal based on customer characteristics, purchase context and/or product characteristics is referred to as next best offer. We explain how decision trees can help you in providing the best suitable offer to your customers, which gives them the feeling that you understand their needs and increases conversion.\n\nChapter 4: Preventing Customers to Leave\n\nMany triggers in a customer lifetime might cause customers to leave your company (think about a complaint, an increase in price or a change in their product).  By using random forest, all relevant triggers can be identified, such that customers who are most likely to churn can be addressed and retention measures can be made. \n\nChapter 5: A Data-Driven Company as a Foundation for Success\n\nNow that you have learned so many new predictive modelling techniques, how are you going to communicate and apply them in your daily work? This chapter will help you identify the maturity of your organisation as a data-driven company and will give you tools how to grow towards a more data-driven organisation. In the end, all organisations need to embrace data analytics in order to survive in this data-oriented world.\n\nWho should take this course?\n\nThis course is suited for a variety of different experience levels. We invite anyone who is eager to learn more about data analytics and predictive modelling to join us. More specific groups include:  \n\n• Marketers who want to learn more about predictive modelling and especially what data can do for you.\n• Data scientists who want to bring their modelling as well as data presentation skills one step further.\n• Business managers who want to have a better grasp and understanding of data models and how to build a strategy based on this data.  \n\nWhat should I know before the course begins?\n\nThis course requires some coding using the programming language R. If you have never used R before, don&#39;t worry, we will help you along the way! We will show you how to install the software and explain corresponding concepts as we move through the material. However, we require you to understand basic statistical concepts, including:\n• Mean/average\n• Standard deviation\n• Normal distribution  \n\nWhat is included in this course?\n\nBy enrolling in this course, you will gain access to:\n• All Course Material\n• R Package\n• Fact-Based Marketing Scan\n• Challenging &amp; Fun Assignments\n• Interactive Global Community\n• Flexible Time Management\n\nUpon completion of this course, you will receive:\n• A Statement of Participation   \n\nIn addition, this course offers flexible time management. With a workload of 12-16 hours, the suggested course length is about 5 weeks. If you can’t spare 3-4 hours a week or would rather finish the course faster, you can do so as well. Take as little or as much time as you need and complete the course at your own pace.\n\nWant to discover the online learning experience?\n\n \n","currency_unit":"€","amount":"300/month","instructors":[{"name":"Steven Kraal","bio":"Principal consultant @VODW\n\nSteven Kraal helps companies make better use of data.

In this course, you&#39;ll learn to think through and make your design a better experience for your users by sketching, experimenting, creating and testing.\n\nIn this six week course, you will be working on a prototype for a concept you’ll develop in the first weeks involving a mobile device. You will explore different types of prototyping, from paper prototypes to a digital prototype and eventually even a physical prototype. \n\nIn a world where we have to deal with new technologies on a daily basis, the prototyping process will help you understand the user and the way he or she interacts with these new and existing technologies. Understanding and executing this process will make your design stronger and more valuable to the end user.\n\nWhat will I learn?\n\nBy the end of the course, you know how to incorporate prototyping interaction in your design process. This will not only make your design process more effective, it will also help you gain new insights about the user and the way he or she interacts with your product or service.\n\nWhat do I need to know?\n\nNo prior knowledge is required, but some practical experience in UX design, interaction design and design principles is recommended since the course is covering prototyping for user experience for mobile devices but also physical prototyping.

So why is health not more prominent topic in the debate on climate change and its impacts? We hear a lot about polar bears and smokestacks in the media, but very little on the many and the large health impacts of climate change. With this MOOC, we want to provide state-of-the art evidence of the link between climate change and the health of populations.\n\nWho is this course for?\n\nWe address the general public from all parts of the world.\nHealth professionals may have a special interest and are very welcome, so are teachers and journalists, who may use this MOOC to disseminate the evidence provided.

We often use these terms without a proper awareness of their meanings and connections, a circumstance not exactly helpful for any attempt to understand how politics really works, regardless of our wishful thinking or simplistic morality or easy cynicism.  \n\nNow, if we want to go deeper into the workings of politics - the only serious starting point for those who want reform - we must agree to begin with very abstract notions. This includes the general definitions of what politics, conflict, power (incl. force/violence), and what legitimate power mean (Part 1: What is Politics?). On these premises, we will then explain the still main political institution, the state, and peer into the dynamics of war and peace that has dominated the relationships between the states (Part 2: How Does Politics Work?). Since with economic globalisation, which has restricted the room for political action, things are getting much more complicated on the planet, and more challenging outside of it (man-made climate change starts in the atmosphere), classical notions have to be rethought. The very nature of the threats endangering our global commons does not leave the definition of politics (Part 3: World Politics and the Future).  \n\nThis course does not aim at communicating any &#39;message&#39; as to how politics ought to be. However, we will obviously try to clarify the main concepts - freedom, equality, justice - concepts we will make use of while talking about values and principles in politics. This is, what is called  &#39;normative political philosophy&#39; and is regarded here as an important chapter of political philosophy, not the whole of it (Part 4: Ethics and Politics).  \n\nWhat will I learn?\n\nAt the end of the course, you will have achieved a clearer and less confused awareness of political vocabulary, thus gaining a more complex, more autonomous and more critical understanding of political processes. If you are a student of political science, law, sociology and economics you will gain better tools for catching the overarching sense of processes. This will help you overcome an otherwise fragmented perspective and perspective.  \n\nMy teaching method aims primarily at defining and discussing concepts, not illustrating authors or providing historical narratives; needless to say, there will be plenty of references to authors, books, events and processes, in particular with regard to the evolution of political modernity.  \n\nWhat do I have to know?\n\nDue to my conceptual approach, to follow this course you do not need a prior knowledge of philosophy or political science, just the degree of general culture needed to pass the final high school exam, be it Abitur, maturità, baccalauréat or 高考(gao kao).  \n\nCourse Structure\n\nChapter 1:\n\nAim and method of the course.

How can you clearly communicate complex ideas and project plans? How can you generate interest and captivate your audience? The answer lies in &quot;Visual Thinking&quot;, a growing trend that originates from Silicon Valley and the Stanford D-School: practitioners as well as researchers have realised that the more complex, dynamic and electronic the business environment becomes, the more important it is to be able to master such complexity via visualisation in meetings, presentations and discussions.\n\nThis is the first public online course offered by the top-tier business school, the WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management. The Economist places WHU&#39;s MBA programme at #6 in the world and the Financial Times calls it the #1 MBA and Masters in Management programme in Germany.

The course is taught by the award-winning Prof. Dr. Christoph Hienerth, the Chair of the Entrepreneurship and New Business Development at WHU.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will master two very important tools:  \n\nElementary drawing skills\n\nYou will learn to create representative objects and artefacts as well as people and characters. This includes:\n•  Revealing essential problems everyone faces in drawing and overcoming your fears\n•  How to draw and visualise simple forms, people, perspective and the third dimension\n•  Making drawing a daily habit and a simple routine    \n\n\n\nVisual presentation skills in the business setting\n\nYou will learn visual structuring methods so that you can transfer elementary drawing skills to the business environment and explain complex concepts with the common language of visualisation. This includes:\n•  Visual thinking and communication techniques\n•  The visual setting in meetings (flip-charts, whiteboards, blackboards, etc.)\n•  Some psychological aspects of communication between the presenter and the audience\n•  Essential visualisation tools for business\n•  The option to take your skills to the next level using free electronic drawing software  \n\n\n\n\nWho should take this course?\n\nThe course learnings can be applied to many expertise levels and sectors.
